    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lab we will learn to how to reconstruct an outdoor scene to test robots using NVIDIA fVDB framework and NVIDIA Omniverse NuRec rendering in Isaac Sim. We will walk through core reconstruction and rendering technologies, with a step-by-step workflow for simulating an entire outdoor environment for testing any robot. We will learn how to position images using structure from motion, train a 3D Gaussian splatting scene, extract 3D mesh, and convert to USD for simulation in Isaac Sim. This lab is split into two parts. In [Part 1](#part-1-creating-a-digital-twin-with-gaussian-splatting), we will learn how to gather good data, use a SfM tool, and train a Gaussian splatting scene. In [Part 2](#Part-2-creating-an-isaac-sim-scene), we will switch focus to robotic simulation. We will import the files from [Part 1](#part-1-creating-a-digital-twin-with-gaussian-splatting) into Isaac Sim and use Isaac Lab to move a [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) robot around the scene."

    "Your reconstruction can only be as good as the data you start with, because of this it's crucial to have good images. For outdoor scenes there are some best practices you can follow to get good results. \n",
    "* If you have one main object or area you're focusing on it is recommended to circle or orbit it with a camera equipped aerial vehicle. More details on object centric collection can be found in [nerf_dataset_tips.md]( https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/blob/master/docs/nerf_dataset_tips.md).\n",
    "* For larger outdoor scenes with no one specific focus either overlapping circular orbits, or traditional oblique mapping flight lines produce good quality results. An example flight mode for a popular drone model can be found [here](https://enterprise-insights.dji.com/blog/smart-oblique-capture).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will show an example of an orbit collection using a video captured during flight. Frames are extracted every second or so for training. [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), an open-source software for audio and video file processing, can be used to save individual frames from a video. Below is an example of how you can save 1 frame per second out as an image from an input video."

    "### Run Structure from Motion (COLMAP)\n",
    "Many radiance field rendering methods, including 3D Gaussian Splatting, require the camera positions and a sparse point cloud of the scene for initialization. We currently have a folder of raw images, but no corresponding camera location or pose information. We can use a structure from motion tool (SfM) to estimate where the camera was for each image and to create a sparse point cloud of the scene. A commonly used SfM tool is [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/install.html), which we will use in combination with GLOMAP. [GLOMAP](https://github.com/colmap/glomap) replaces COLMAP's mapper step, focusing on global positioning rather than incremental, and can run 10 or even 100 times faster than COLMAP's. Below we have provided example commands, there's no need to run them here as we have provided the result from an existing SfM run. You can run these commands on your own data by downloading COLMAP and GLOMAP and changing the **/Data/Path** to a directory that contains the **images_raw** folder of your data.\n"

We will use an [fVDB](https://github.com/openvdb/fvdb-core) example project called [fVDB Reality Capture](https://github.com/openvdb/fvdb-reality-capture) for visualization, manipulation and training. fVDB is a framework for encoding and operating on sparse voxel hierarchies of features in PyTorch. Voxels are like pixels but they are cubes instead of squares, making them three dimensional. Sparse means we only have voxels in areas of our scene that that are occupied, voxels that don't contain anything are not represented. fVDB Reality Capture (fRC) is toolbox for reality capture tasks built on top of fVDB. It gathers the tools required to create an Isaac Sim compatible 3D reconstruction from a set of images and uses fVDB to make the tools fast and efficient.\n",

    "#### Train a Gaussian Splatting Scene \n",
    "In this section we will walk through training a Gaussian splatting scene from a set of images and a SfM output, but let's start with what a Gaussian splatting scene is.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3D Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) is the dominant radiance field representation. A [radiance field](https://radiancefields.com/) is a 3D scene representation that specifies the color of a point along a given view direction. Radiance fields enable high fidelity visualization of 3D captures with realistic lighting effects. 3D Gaussian splats encode a radiance field function as a sum of 3D Gaussian functions or splats, parameterized by their means (positions), rotations, and scales. Additionally each splat has an opacity value and a set of spherical harmonics that map the direction in which a Gaussian is viewed to a color. Each scene is made up of thousands to millions of these 3-dimensional splats. Think of them as similar to voxels, or points in a point cloud. We start with splats in the same positions as the points in the sparse point cloud from our SfM run. During training splats are added, removed, split, and changed until the Gaussian splatting scene is capable of producing renders that are nearly identical to the training images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an understanding of what a Gaussian splatting scene is, let's train our own. The core API for Gaussian Splat reconstruction is the `fvdb_reality_capture.GaussianSplatReconstruction` class. It accepts an input `SfmScene` and optional config parameters, and produces an `fvdb.GaussianSplat3d` reconstructing the scene. This functionally is also written in `/fvdb_reality_capture/cli/frgs/_reconstruct.py`. F We will show how to use both methods."

    "#### Convert to a Mesh\n",
    "In order for a robot to move around in Isaac Sim there needs to be a surface it can interact with. Gaussian splatting scenes cannot represent a solid surface in Isaac Sim, so we need to convert our splats to something capable of acting as a surface a robot can collide with. Specifically we will convert the splats into a mesh. Our Gaussian splat model is capable of producing images and depths from novel views. A natural way to reconstruct a mesh from a Gaussian scene is by rendering depth maps from the camera poses used to reconstruct the model and fuse them into a truncated signed distance field (TSDF) using the TSDF fusion algorithm<sup>[\\[2\\]](#references)</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "TSDF fusion accumulates noisy depth maps into a voxel grid, to approximate a signed distance field near the surface of the object. `fvdb_reality_capture` makes use of `fvdb-core` to provide a high performance implementation of TSDF integration on sparse voxels. This allows us to generate meshes from Gaussian splats at very high resolutions on the GPU while using minimal memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TSDF fusion algorithm is based on the paper: [KinectFusion: Real-Time Dense Surface Mapping and Tracking](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/kinectfusion-real-time-3d-reconstruction-and-interaction-using-a-moving-depth-camera/).\n",
    "The DLNR foundation model is described in the paper: [High-frequency Stereo Matching Network](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Zhao_High-Frequency_Stereo_Matching_Network_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf).\n",
    "In short, this algorithm works by rendering stereo pairs of images from multiple views of the Gaussian splat model, and using DLNR to compute depth maps from these stereo pairs. The depth maps and images are then integrated into a sparse `fvdb.Grid` in a narrow band around the surface using a weighted averaging scheme. The algorithm returns this grid along with signed distance values and colors (or other features) at each voxel.\n",
    "The mesh can then be extracted from the TSDF using the marching cubes algorithm implemented in `fvdb.marching_cubes.marching_cubes`."

    "As we saw in Supersplat, splats end up beyond the main focus of our scene. The training process tries to reconstruct the details in all the images, even details far in the horizon. This can lead to messing looking edges. You can remove the edges in Supersplat but we will crop both the mesh and PLY to focus on the center of our scene using **create_isaac_sim_ready_files.py**. Isaac Sim also uses different world axes coordinates than COLMAP, it assumes Z+ is up rather than -Y, so we will rotate the scene accordingly. Additionally, to ensure our mesh will act as a collider in Isaac Sim we will make it water tight. This will fill in holes in the mesh and smooth it out. While we are at it we will convert the mesh from a PLY to an OBJ, a format compatible with Isaac Sim. Isaac Sim doesn't understand a Gaussian splatting scene in PLY format either, so we will have to convert ours into something Isaac Sim can render. We will convert it to a Universal Scene Description Zip (USDZ), this is a compressed version of the USD file type commonly used with Isaac Sim."
